## Overview

This project aims to showcase the capabilities of a transformer-based model in text generation. The model is trained on a large text dataset and uses attention mechanisms to generate coherent and contextually relevant text given an initial input prompt. It can be used for various applications such as chatbots, text completion, creative writing assistants, and more.

## Features

- Text generation based on input prompts.
- Transformer architecture for improved performance in NLP tasks.
- Simple interface with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for easy interaction.
- Supports multiple types of text generation use cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **PyTorch**: For building and training the Transformer model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the user interface and deploying the app.
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**: For data handling, manipulation, and visualization.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyasmysore24/-Transformer-Based-Language-Model-.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd -Transformer-Based-Language-Model-

3. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1.After installing the dependencies, you can start the app by running:
    streamlit run app.py
    
2.This will launch the app in your browser where you can enter a text prompt, and the model will generate text based on that input.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Transformer architecture with self-attention mechanisms, making it efficient at understanding and generating contextually relevant text. The model is based on the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
Self-Attention Layers: Allow the model to focus on different parts of the input text.
Feed-forward Neural Networks: For processing the attention outputs.
Output Layer: Generates the predicted next word in the sequence.
For a deeper understanding, check out the original paper on [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762).

## Training

The model is trained on a large corpus of text. Training details and configurations can be found in the train.py file. The model is saved after training as bigram_language_model.pth and bigram_language_model_complete.pth.

You can modify the training script to use different datasets or tweak the hyperparameters for fine-tuning.
